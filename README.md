# Minecraft Raylib Remake
Remaking minecraft in [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib), current assets are temporary.

## Multiplayer
A very simple multiplayer has already been implemented using [libwebsockets](https://github.com/warmcat/libwebsockets) with the backend built on [node-multiplayer](https://github.com/raxracks/node-multiplayer).   
To run the server install dependencies with `npm i` then run with `node server.js`.

## Building
A makefile will be created later but for now just execute `./build.sh` inside the `game` folder.

This game is not affiliated with Mojang or Microsoft in any way.
